🚢 Titanic Data Analysis: Traditional vs LLM-Assisted Approaches
📖 Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset using both traditional data analysis methods and LLM-assisted techniques (Large Language Models like GPT-4). It demonstrates how combining these methods can offer a more efficient, accurate, and insightful approach to data analysis. The study includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling, complemented by a detailed research paper.

📊 Key Analysis and Findings
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values using both traditional (median/mode imputation) and LLM-assisted methods.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explored relationships between variables, including survival rates across different categories.
Feature Engineering: Created new features such as 'FamilySize' and 'IsAlone' to enhance predictive modeling.
Predictive Modeling: Implemented logistic regression and decision tree models to predict survival rates.
📑 Research Paper
The detailed research paper is available in the research/Research_Paper.md file. It offers a comprehensive comparison between traditional and LLM-assisted data analysis methods, including key findings and insights.
